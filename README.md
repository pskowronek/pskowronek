### Hi! I'm Piotr Skowronek.
*  *  *  *  *

I'm a software geek, tinkering with computers and programming since the '90s when I was in primary school. I started with Pascal, then dived into ASM x86 to later explore plethora of different languages. Throughout all the years, Java is still the language of choice for more advanced projects. From time to time, I try out other things or return to low-level programming (like Arduino ASM). Iâ€™ve worn many hats in my tech career: engineer _aka_ individual contributor, technical lead, engineering manager. I'm also a devoted fan of open-source.
