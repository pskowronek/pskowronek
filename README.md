### Hi! I'm Piotr Skowronek.
*  *  *  *  *

I'm a software geek, tinkering with computers and programming since the '90s when I was in primary school. I started with Pascal, then dived into ASM x86 to later explore plethora of different languages. Throughout all the years, Java ☕️ is still the language of choice for more advanced projects. From time to time, I try out other things or return to low-level programming (like Arduino ASM). I've worn many hats in my tech career: engineer  _aka_ individual contributor 👷, technical lead 🚀, engineering manager 👔. I'm also a devoted fan of open source 🌐🔓.
